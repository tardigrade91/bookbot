# bookbot
bookbot project for boot.dev 

BookBot is my first git project

book bot, in this case, takes the text of the book Frankenstein, and counts the number of words and the occurances of each letter. the script main.py is hard coded to reference the frankenstein.txt file in the books directory. 

there is no method here of paramaterizing another book for analysis.
